Mid-day meals analytics involves the systematic analysis of data related to school lunch programs, particularly in the context of providing nutritious meals to school children. By collecting and analyzing data on meal distribution, food quality, nutritional content, and attendance, education authorities and policymakers can gain valuable insights. These insights can be used to optimize meal planning, improve resource allocation, and ensure that the program effectively meets the nutritional needs of students, ultimately contributing to their health and educational outcomes.
